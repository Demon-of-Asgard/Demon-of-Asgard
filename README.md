## Manu George 

Hi I am Manu George

I hold a PhD in Theoretical Physics. During the past few years I have been participating in the development of the opensource simulation engine for the phenomenon called neutrino fast flavor conversion. We have already publshed the first version which simulate the spatio-temporal eveolution of different angular modes of the above phenomenon. Currently I am working as a algorithm/software developer at [Praanatech](https://www.praanatech.com/) where I develop, adapt and test various algorithms for image reconstruction pertainig to company's cutting edge hardwares.
